# Project Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

## 1. Create a Python Environment using Conda

First, create a Python environment named `env` with Python version 3.10. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
conda create --name env python=3.10
```
After the environment is created, activate it using the command:

```bash
conda activate env
```

## 2. Install the Required Libraries

Next, install the required libraries specified in the `requirements.txt` file. Run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the libraries needed for the project to run properly.

## 3. Run the Project

Finally, run the project by executing the `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py
```
